    <h3 align="center">National Parks Service App</h3>
  </a>
</div>

An app with two components: a dashboard displaying various data for each NPS unit and an interactive table of NPS units with the ability to sort the entire list by distance from a user provided location. The general gist of the app is to assist in choosing which NPS units to visit.

Created with Plotly Dash. Data obtained from the [NPS](https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), and the National Weather Service [CDO API](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/stations)
